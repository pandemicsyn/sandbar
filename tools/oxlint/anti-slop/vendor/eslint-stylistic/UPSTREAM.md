# Vendored padding-line-between-statements

Source: [ESLint Stylistic](https://github.com/eslint-stylistic/eslint-stylistic), commit `435c3ea0fd26a5fef9042c4b36b6e165fbbf8d08`.

Copied files:

- `packages/eslint-plugin/rules/padding-line-between-statements/padding-line-between-statements.ts`
- `packages/eslint-plugin/rules/padding-line-between-statements/types.d.ts` → `padding-line-options.d.ts`
- Root `LICENSE`, retained verbatim. Both OpenJS Foundation and ESLint Stylistic notices apply.

The rule is MIT-licensed. Keep `LICENSE` with every redistributed copy, including skill assets. No Stylistic, ESLint, TypeScript-ESLint, or additional parser runtime dependency is required.

## Local adaptations

- Replace upstream type aliases with Oxlint's ESTree, context, token/comment, and rule types. Upstream's token type includes comments; Oxlint exposes those separately.
- Replace `AST_NODE_TYPES` enum members with identical string literals.
- Guard indexed reads for consuming repositories with `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`. Impossible missing AST/configuration entries raise explicit invariant errors rather than introducing new non-null assertions.
- Replace the repository-specific `createRule` factory with `createPaddingLineRule(options)`. The anti-slop wrapper supplies typed options directly; it exposes no user configuration options.
- Implement the small required AST helper surface in `padding-line-ast.ts` using Oxlint's public source-code/token API. `isParenthesized` only needs the one-pair check used to exclude parenthesized directive strings, not the upstream general-purpose overloads.
- Retain the upstream statement matchers, scope tracking, comment-aware insertion/removal, selector support, and diagnostic text. Upstream naming and non-null assumptions remain localized here to keep future diffs reviewable; the file is not a model for new application code.

The opinionated policy lives outside this directory in `../../rules/require-readable-spacing.ts`. It adds spacing without collapsing existing blank lines. Short local bindings, consecutive imports, and adjacent overload signatures/implementation remain grouped. Spacing is syntactic, not an inference of business-logic boundaries.

## Updating and verification

Fetch an explicit upstream revision, compare the original rule and types against this revision, and port relevant fixes while retaining the adapters above. Update this record and preserve the license. The upstream anti-slop repository uses `pnpm check` and `pnpm sync:skill-assets`; Sandbar instead validates its vendored copy with its Bun lint, test, format check, typecheck, and build commands.

The upstream anti-slop repository at the source commit has focused Oxlint RuleTester cases in `src/rules/require-readable-spacing.test.ts` and `src/rules/require-readable-spacing-cli.test.ts`. The install skill bundles production source only, so these tests are not present in this vendored tree. Sandbar verified the rule through its application lint, safe autofix, format check, and a second fix/format pass that made no changes. These checks demonstrate integration with the current application source, not full upstream rule conformance.
